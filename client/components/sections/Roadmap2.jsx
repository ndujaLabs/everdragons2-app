      `### Background Story

972 Everdragons discovered a hospitable planet and established a community in the Ethereum blockchain.

A few of them, the most adventurous, crossed the ocean to reach Tron and, later, POA Network, where 360 new dragons have been born.`,

      `### Current time

On September 17th, 2021, [Agdaroth](https://opensea.io/assets/everdragons2.eth/10001), a mysterious black dragon, landed on the Ethereum blockchain and laid 10000 eggs to give birth to the EverDragons2.

She is willing to give free eggs to every protector of an original Everdragons, and sell 8000 to the most excellent collectors.

#### 1000 eggs are collected
Agdaroth will give one rare dragon to three humans who welcomed the first eggs.

#### 3000 eggs are collected
She will donate more dragons to the most active members of the welcoming community of humans.

#### 5000 eggs are collected
She will airdrop special dragons to the most passionate community members.

#### 7000 eggs are collected
Agdaroth will gift four couples of Everdragons2 with an adorable, beautiful cub.

#### All the eggs are collected
A new bridge will be built to allow the Everdragons2 to cross the oceans. Then, the dragons' riders will donate 10+ ETH to a non-profit organization whose mission is to save the last dragons on Earth from extinction. The organization will send a thank you video to the community expressing their gratitude and explaining how the funds will be used.

When the eggs hatch, the dragons will be listed on Rarity Tools and other marketplaces.
Special bonus: an avatar with the dragon's head will be airdropped on Polygon Network for every Everdragons2 to all the holders.

Finally, the Dragons' Cavern will open its doors.
An exclusive club where Everdragons2 holders can become dragons' riders. They will grow the project with the initial riders, vote for vital decisions, and suggest new directions, including games and battles between the most formidable dragons.

#### Going towards the future
More Everdragons will populate the planet. Holders of two or more Everdragons2 will have babies for free, mutant dragons will show up, and formidable new species will appear out of a sudden.
